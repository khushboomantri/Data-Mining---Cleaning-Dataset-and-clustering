# Data-Mining---Cleaning-Dataset-and-clustering
The aim of this project is to clean data of an e-commerce site, process it and find the clusters.
Products need to be clustered together if they have the same conditions even if they belong to different listings in a single group.

Preprocessing steps


1. Remove all the special characters present, except comma (,) and semicolon (:).

2. Discard all single characters.

3. Carry out multiple to single mapping of commas (,) and semicolons (:).

4. Remove all the leading, sandwiched and trailing additional spaces.

5. Make the data case insensitive.



Step to execute the code


python evalAiCluster.py
